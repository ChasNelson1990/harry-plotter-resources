# harry-plotter-resources
A small collection of resources for my School of Engineering and Computing Sciences SSCC talk: "Harry Plotter and the Multiple Visualisation Softwares".

Sample data in the 'data' folder is used for the R, MATLAB and LaTeX codes in this resource.

Other folders are names by language. Each folder includes some example and a 'resources.tex' file with links to further resources.
